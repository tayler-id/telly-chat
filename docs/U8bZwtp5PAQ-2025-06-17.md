Hello I'm Mike and in this video I'll show
you start to finish how to build your very first SaaS using no code
with Claude Code. Let's dive in. First thing you're going to do is download
Node.js. It's really easy. And they have a version
for every operating system. I'm on a Mac so it's easy,
but you can do it on Windows too. Just note with windows you'll need to do
Linux On Windows with WSL that's a little more complicated. With Mac you just install
and then run the Mac terminal like this. You type in terminal
and there's your terminal. Now once you've installed node
and it's all up and running, you just enter this simple command here, which I'll put in the description down
below. This will take two seconds to install. Cool code like that. next we're going to run Claude Code for the first time
and make sure it's all set up. And to do that, we just type. Claude. On the first run,
it's simply going to ask you, do you want to use a Claude account
with subscriptions? So if you already have a Claude
I sub, that's perfect. $20 a month or $100 a month for max. Or you can use the Anthropic console,

get any unnecessary surprises. I use both as you go
and I try to keep an eye on the billing. You'll see here from the Anthropic
pricing page. Actually, Pro is very reasonable and gives you access
to cloud code in your terminal. But if yo...

### üìã Action Plan

Based on the video transcript, here's a comprehensive action plan for building a no-code SaaS using Claude Code:

SUMMARY:
The video demonstrates how to build a YouTube comment analyzer SaaS application using Claude Code, requiring minimal coding knowledge. The tool analyzes YouTube video comments to provide actionable insights.

PREREQUISITES:
- Computer (Mac or Windows)
- Internet connection
- Basic terminal/command line familiarity
- Claude API subscription ($20/month Pro or $100/month Max) or Anthropic console access

STEP-BY-STEP ACTION PLAN:

1. Setup Environment (15-20 minutes)
   - Download and install Node.js for your operating system
   - If using Windows, install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
   - Install Claude Code using terminal command (provided in video description)
   - Download and install Cursor (free or pro version)

2. Project Initialization (10 minutes)
   - Create a new project folder
   - Open project in Cursor
   - Launch terminal within Cursor
   - Run Claude Code using 'claude' command
   - Initialize project using '/init' command

3. Configure Project Settings (15 minutes)
   - Create Claude.md file with project specifications
   - Define project requirements and architecture
   - Use '/config' command to set Claude model to Claude 4 Opus
   - Save all configuration files

4. Development Setup (20 minutes)
   - Write initial prompt describing the SaaS functionality
   - Let Claude Code generate necessary files and structure
   - Review generated readme file
   - Verify project architecture in Claude.md

5. Implementation and Testing (30-60 minutes)
   - Follow Claude Code's generated setup instructions
   - Add required API keys
   - Start the server
   - Test basic functionality

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- Functioning YouTube comment analyzer SaaS
- Clean UI with YouTube's red and white color scheme
- Mobile-responsive application
- Ability to analyze comments for insights and sentiment

COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
- Not using Claude 4 Opus model (less effective results)
- Skipping proper configuration steps
- Providing unclear initial prompts
- Not saving configuration files
- Ignoring the Claude.md file updates

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:
- Creator Magic Premium community for Stripe integration
- Anthropic pricing page for subscription options
- Cursor documentation
- Node.js documentation

Note: Actual development time may vary based on experience level and specific requirements.
