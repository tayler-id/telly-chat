[Music] I guess as we're getting started this talk is about productionizing AI but I'm curious um I keep asking this question and it keeps changing how many of you folks have um llm applications in production in your company wow that's probably the highest ever seen More than 70% so why did you come to this talk you you figured it out right it's not going great not going great all right you want to put it in slideshow mode oh it is in slideshow mode okay hey you're showing my IP to the whole uh audience um you might ask if custom Solutions purchas L solution oh good question yeah how many is uh custom Solutions interesting that's going be 30% and how many purchase Solutions Wow way way less what are you what are you purchasing well I put like co-pilot from GitHub in that category of using okay well if you put co-pilot in that category how many have purchased Solutions we got to be most right interesting interesting thanks for the any more should we crowdsource more questions no we can begin awesome um all right so I want to talk um briefly about our experience with our customers productionizing gen models but I want to give you a little bit of context first of all um this is clearly preaching the choir but it's interesting to see that democratization of AI is here I don't know how many people were working in AI 10 years ago nice 15 years ago so yeah ml totally counts 100% ml counts um ml definitely counts as a type of AI absolutely um you know I think people talked about the...

# Productionizing AI Applications - Action Plan

## Brief Summary
This talk discusses the challenges of moving AI applications, particularly LLMs, from demo to production environments. It emphasizes that while AI demos are easy to create, productionization is significantly more complex and requires a different approach than traditional software development, focusing on experimentation and learning documentation rather than linear development.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Development team with either ML engineers or software developers
- Access to AI/LLM resources (either custom or purchased solutions)
- Budget for AI development tools and infrastructure

## Step-by-Step Action Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (2-3 weeks)
1. **Assessment & Planning** (1 week)
   - Audit existing AI capabilities
   - Define specific use case and success metrics
   - Document requirements and constraints
   Tools needed: Project management software

2. **Infrastructure Setup** (1 week)
   - Set up development environment
   - Install necessary AI development tools (e.g., Weights & Biases)
   - Configure monitoring and logging systems
   Tools needed: Cloud platform, MLOps tools

3. **Team Organization** (3-5 days)
   - Assign roles and responsibilities
   - Establish communication channels
   - Set up documentation processes
   Tools needed: Collaboration tools, documentation platform

### Phase 2: Development & Experimentation (4-8 weeks)
4. **Initial Prototyping** (2 weeks)
   - Create proof of concept
   - Document all experiments
   - Test different approaches
   Tools needed: AI development platform, experiment tracking system

5. **Experimentation Documentation** (Ongoing)
   - Log all prompts tried
   - Record successful and failed attempts
   - Document learning outcomes
   Tools needed: Experiment tracking software

6. **Iteration & Refinement** (2-4 weeks)
   - Optimize successful approaches
   - Conduct systematic testing
   - Gather feedback
   Tools needed: Testing framework, feedback collection tools

### Phase 3: Productionization (4-6 weeks)
7. **Production Environment Setup** (2 weeks)
   - Configure scalable infrastructure
   - Implement security measures
   - Set up monitoring
   Tools needed: Cloud services, security tools

8. **Quality Assurance** (2 weeks)
   - Develop testing protocols
   - Implement error handling
   - Create fallback mechanisms
   Tools needed: Testing frameworks, monitoring tools

9. **Deployment & Monitoring** (2 weeks)
   - Gradual rollout
   - Monitor performance
   - Document operational procedures
   Tools needed: Deployment tools, monitoring dashboard

## Expected Outcomes
- Production-ready AI application
- Documented experimentation history
- Robust monitoring system
- Established maintenance procedures
- Knowledge retention system

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. Rushing from demo to production
2. Not documenting failed experiments
3. Losing institutional knowledge when team members leave
4. Treating AI development like traditional software development
5. Inadequate monitoring and error handling
6. Not having fallback mechanisms
7. Insufficient security measures
8. Poor experiment tracking
9. Lack of systematic testing approach
10. Not considering scalability early enough

## Success Metrics
- System reliability (uptime, response time)
- Error rates and recovery
- User satisfaction metrics
- Business value metrics
- Knowledge retention effectiveness

Remember: The key to successful AI productionization is treating it as an experimental process rather than a linear development journey, and maintaining thorough documentation of both successes and failures.
