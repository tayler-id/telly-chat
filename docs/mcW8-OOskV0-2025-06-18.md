[Music] Miniax just dropped a 1 million token language model that anyone can use for free. No payw wall, no API limits, no vendor lockin. And it's not just big, it's smarter, faster, and cheaper to train than anything we've seen from the open-source world. We're talking full book series memory, 80,000 token responses, and performance that challenges models costing over $100 million. built for just half a million. This changes the game. So, let's talk about it. All right. The biggest number in the launch post is the context window. 1 million input tokens with room for an 80,000 token reply. A token is nothing mysterious. It is simply a tiny chunk of text, often a word piece that the model understands. If you mashed all the Harry Potter books into a single prompt, you would still be safely below a million tokens. So M1 can keep an entire book series in its short-term memory while it writes. For comparison, OpenAI's GPT 40 can juggle about 1/8 of that. Claude 4 Opus can hold a fifth. And Google Gemini 2.5 Pro matches the million on input, but has a shorter reply limit. The well-known open- source model Deepseek R1 tops out at 128,000 both ways. In simple terms, M1 has breathing room that other public models do not. Holding that much text usually slams into the Transformers problem of attention cost ballooning as sequences get longer. MiniaX sidestep this by combining two ideas. First, the model uses a mixture of experts design. Think of it as 32 specialist submodels that share o...

### üìã Action Plan

Based on the video transcript, here's a comprehensive action plan for implementing a large language model similar to Miniax's M1:

SUMMARY:
Miniax has developed a 1-million-token language model that combines mixture of experts design with lightning attention for efficient processing. The model achieves comparable performance to much more expensive models while being significantly cheaper to train and more memory-efficient.

PREREQUISITES:
- Access to 512 Nvidia H800 GPUs or equivalent
- Approximately $535,000 for training costs
- Deep learning expertise
- Data processing infrastructure
- Training pipeline setup

STEP-BY-STEP ACTION PLAN:

1. Data Preparation (2-3 months)
   - Collect 7.5 trillion tokens of training data
   - Focus on 70% STEM, code, books, and reasoning content
   - Clean and deduplicate data
   Tools needed: Data processing pipeline, storage infrastructure

2. Model Architecture Setup (1 month)
   - Implement mixture of experts design (32 specialist submodels)
   - Set up lightning attention mechanism
   - Configure 7 regular transformer layers
   Tools needed: Deep learning framework (PyTorch/TensorFlow)

3. Initial Pre-training (3-4 months)
   - Execute standard pre-training on collected dataset
   - Monitor training stability
   - Implement 32-bit float precision for language model head
   Tools needed: GPU cluster, training monitoring tools

4. Supervised Learning Phase (1-2 months)
   - Inject long chain-of-thought answers
   - Train on step-by-step solution examples
   Tools needed: Annotated dataset, training pipeline

5. Reinforcement Learning Implementation (3 weeks)
   - Set up CISPO (Clipped Importance Sampling Policy Optimization)
   - Implement three-stage curriculum:
     a) Rule-based tasks (math, puzzles, programming)
     b) Single-correct answer tasks
     c) Open-ended tasks
   Tools needed: GenRM reward model, testing infrastructure

6. Scaling and Optimization (1 month)
   - Gradually increase reply length (40K to 80K tokens)
   - Balance dataset at each stage
   - Fine-tune learning controls
   Tools needed: Monitoring tools, testing suite

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:
- 1M token context window capability
- 80K token response limit
- 86% accuracy on AM 2024
- 65% performance on live code bench
- Efficient processing with reduced FLOPS

COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID:
1. Numerical precision issues in final layer
2. Output loops and repetitive patterns
3. Length bias in reward models
4. Training instability at large context windows
5. Unbalanced datasets during scaling
6. Inadequate monitoring of training progress

MONITORING METRICS:
- Perplexity levels
- Response quality
- Training stability
- Resource utilization
- Performance benchmarks

Total Estimated Timeline: 8-11 months
Estimated Budget: $535,000+ (training costs only)

Note: This plan assumes significant technical expertise and resources. Actual implementation may require adjustments based on available infrastructure and specific requirements.
