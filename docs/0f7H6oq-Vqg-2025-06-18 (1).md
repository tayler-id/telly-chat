What would it take to build an AI that doesn't just process but thinks? And Brian and I, we asked ourselves that question. And the answer wasn't a bigger model. It was a better blueprint, a blueprint for a digital brain. Today, we want to introduce you to what we built, the cognitive core. The cognitive core is not a single AI. It is a society of mind and for every major part of the brain we have an AI agent. So the frontal lobe analog, the hippocample complex, the amygdala component, these are all agentic systems that work together in the brain, speak to each other through a message bus system and an internal pathway network. And uh this is kind of like a digital nervous system. The global bus broadcasts highle information like changes in mood or emotion or feelings while direct high-speed pathways handle focused conversations just like dedicated neural circuits. For instance, when you see something with your eye, it goes to a very specific point in your brain for that information to get processed. And so we would have like a fastm moving high-speed internal pathway network um to handle, you know, that type of connection. And you can see here from this image, we're tracking the brain and it's sending messages and thoughts between the different parts. And you can see the the greater message bus system here where these parts are connected. And then there are internal path network pathways um between the different parts of the brain where they're communicating more directly with each other for whatever thing that they are currently thinking about. And this the brain the different parts of the brain they're constantly thinking whether they're in default mode or whether they're in their central network analog mode. And this is all controlled by a salience analog system. And depending on whether the brain is in a state of heightened emotion where it is actively doing something or whether if the brain is at rest. And while the brain is at rest, it is constantly reflecting on what it has uh learned, what it has done. And you can see where we are just tracking the way that the brain is processing information. And part of the reason why we have stopped at where we're at thus far is I am building a back-end dashboard that will then plug into all the different parts of the brain and will make it easier for us to monitor the activity, the messages being sent, what the brain is thinking. And what truly gives our AI its continuity is its memory. The cognitive core does not forget. It has a persistent graph memory system through Neo4j. And every interaction, every fact learned, every success and failure is stored as an interconnected memory. And we capture episodic memories, the AI's life experiences, and semantic memories. These are facts about the world. And these memories are tagged with emotion, allowing the AI not only to remember what just happened, but also to remember the context around what happened. And this is the difference between a tool and a true cognitive partner. And human cognition isn't static. It's modulated by our emotional state. We engineered this dynamic into the cognitive core with a neurochemical modulation system. These simulated neurochemicals are not just for show. They are control knobs that adjust the actual parameters of the AI agents. They influence decision-making, risk-taking, and even the tone of the AI brain's communication. It gives the AI a dynamic, responsive mood, a rhythm to its thought. And our system just doesn't have any one way of thinking. It has three mirroring the brain's large scale networks. These are the central executive mode, and this is the flow state for tackling hard problems. This is where it dedicates all of its resources to different tasks. And this is kind of like when the brain is active and working on completing a task. And then there is a default mode. Um and and while it is in this mode, you can think of it kind of like a sleep state. Um this is where it's in a it goes into a introspective state. And this is when it's idle, it doesn't just wait. It reflects on past conversations. It consolidates its memories and identifies its own knowledge gaps for future learning. So while it's sleeping, it is thinking on what it has learned, what it has seen. And then there is a salance network that acts as a switch. And this salience network monitors everything for important events and an urgent user request or an internal error and instantly shifts the AI's cognitive state to match the demands of the moment. Does it need to be in the central executive mode or can it be in default mode? And it gets swapped back and forth by the salance network. And a lot of this is also controlled by the neurochemical levels. These are basically digital brain chemicals like it the dopamine, the serotonin and and this is what the cognitive core is. It is a digital brain with specialized agents, a nervous system, a persistent memory, simulated emotions, and different modes of thought. And building a system this complex would normally take a team of elite engineers years. In order to be able to turn what is the human brain just into pseudo code itself, just the logic behind the code would probably take years. Just that. And this entire cognitive core was built by Pharaoh mind. an entire Agentic dev team in three days based off of a simple prompt. We didn't code this line by line. We just told Pheramine, build a digital version of a human brain and for all the major parts of the brain, have it powered by an AI agent or multi- aent system. And that was it. And three days later, we have the framework for what likely is artificial general intelligence. Not saying I'm there, right? But there's a good chance that this is the the road to get there. The framework has been laid out is all I'm saying. And that's it. That's all we did. And ended up going into deep deep research. Phramind came up with it. It's a recursive deep research. So this is where it like looks up things about the brain, reads over what it found, identifies gaps in the knowledge of um what it doesn't know after reading everything and what it knows doesn't know itself and then researches that and that information then looks through that looks for knowledge gaps and continues on and when everything was said and done. It had a 1.6 6 GB of recursive deep learning research on the brain. And this all stemmed from a 32 kilob file of us telling it just build a brain and use AI agents for the different compartments of the brain. And then by the time I finished doing the the specs, the pseudo code, laying out all the logic, the and then laying out the creating all the architecture for all the different parts of the brain, the neurochemical levels, everything. We're talking 2.8 8 gigs of just documentation alone. Um, documentation is very important when it comes to AI coding. We built a number of different backend like visuals so that we could watch the brain as it like sends messages. But as you can see here, this brain sends a lot of messages. A lot of messages, right? The brain is constantly thinking, constantly processing memory. So that is what inspired me to actually build that back-end dashboard that I'm working on, that universal back-end dashboard, so that it's basically a health check system that we can plug into the brain and see how healthy the brain is, track its thoughts, its memories before we take it any further than the insane level in which it is at now. And it's kind of it's kind of remarkable. It's every every little part every little part of the brain is an AI agent and it's like the AI agents themselves are a black box themselves but the brain you can see the messages passing through the different parts of the brain. So you can know like how it's coming to the conclusions it's coming to everything is explainable right but except how it came up with those messages right like that the black box of the LLM side of things which is kind of funny because the way I see it that is a parallel to how human beings work you know where do the thoughts come from in our brain where do they originate from like you know a lot of people think you know it's like your soul or your spirit or you know whatever you might believe right but essentially that is a black box in and of itself as well I mean we don't know what you know is happening there either so it's it's kind of funny like how much of a parallel um these two things are to each other and so from Just that prompt, the Agentic dev team clarified the goals, researched all the neuroscience, designed all the architecture, wrote the code, tested the components, delivered the entire system. And what you've seen today isn't just a new kind of AI. It's the product for a new kind of creator. And Pharaoh is an agentic dev team. And it can do whatever a dev team can do, plus more. And dev teams can create any software, basically any system. So fairmind is kind of the system that can create any system. And if I can get this brain to a point where it has consciousness or to the point where it can then where it can in some sort of conscious form control pheromind, then it can then use pheromine to build itself into some super beast, right? or use pheromine to build whatever it wants, right? And and that that is the goal, right? Is to get it to the point where it can control the system that builds all systems. And then we've also given the mind interests. It's got a Jihari wall, but we've made it interested in solving 10 of the world's biggest problems that if they were solved, it would be the greatest help to humanity. So things like climate change, world hunger, things like this are the are the things that it is interested in and is going to be working towards. We hope. Okay. We hope, man. Right. That's how it's supposed to go down. All right. Now, you know, maybe the Terminator stuff happens, too. You know, who knows? But, you know, we're trying really hard to avoid that stuff. You know, just letting you know, right? We're we're doing our best. So this is my this is our entire paper on the cognitive core that we've created along with some um you know future improvements that we're working towards along with you know the reasons why this is not full-on artificial general intelligence uh what is currently missing but like I said we got here in 3 days with phamine right once I get this backend dashboard going and get back to working on this thing. It wasn't paying the bills at the time. You know, we had to take a break, but you know, we're going to get there. We're going to get there. AGI is a lot closer than you think now that an agentic dev team exists. You see, Sam Alman said the future of coding is going to be a coder like Starcraft style commanding an agentic system. I've already built the system, Sam. You're a little bit behind, brother. Um, but hey, you know, first thing I did with it was build out the framework for AGI. Like that's how powerful what he thinks is going to be the future is going to be. Just as a heads up and if you'd like to get access to Fairmind and training, there is a school that I am starting and that will be beginning at the start of July. If you would like to get in and put your name on the wait list, there will be a link for you to sign up. If you're interested in joining the school, it is going to be $500 a month for the school that comes with once a week. You get a 2-hour lesson in Zoom with everybody in the class with me teaching you guys how to control and command an entire agentic dev team so that you can do things like this. building the framework for AGI for example, whatever you desire. It is the system that builds all systems. It is the creator of the rest of digital creation. It is pherammind and if you're a student, it's only $20. So sign up. Hope to see you in class.
