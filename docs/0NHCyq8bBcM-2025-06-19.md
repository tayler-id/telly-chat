Awesome. [Music] Thanks so much for coming. Um, I wanted to give a bit of a talk on implementing MCP clients and talk to more about MCP at scale within a large organization like Anthropic. Um, I wanted to give first a little introduction from me. Uh, my name is John. I've spent 20 years building large scale systems and dealing with the problems that that causes. And so I've made a lot of mistakes and uh I'm excited to give maybe some thoughts on avoiding some of those mistakes. I'm currently a member of technical staff here at Anthropic and I've spent the past few months um focusing on tool calling and integration and implementing MCP support for all of our internal like external integrations within the or so looking at tool integration with models we've kind of hit this timeline where uh models only really got good at calling tools uh like kind of late midl last year and suddenly Everyone got very excited because like your model could go and call your Google Drive and then it could call your maps and then it could send a text message to people. And so there's a huge explosion with like very little effort you can make very cool things and so um teams are all trying to move fast. Everyone's moving very fast in AI. Custom endpoints start proliferating for every use case. there's a lot of like services popping up with like slashcall tool and slash like get context and then people um start to realize there's additional needs some authentication a b a bunch of stuff there and this...

### üìã Action Plan

MCP Implementation Action Plan

1. Brief Summary:
The video discusses implementing MCP (Model Context Protocol) at scale within large organizations, specifically focusing on standardizing tool integration with AI models. It explains how using MCP as a universal standard can help avoid integration chaos and duplication of functionality across different services.

2. Key Prerequisites:
- Understanding of JSON RPC
- Knowledge of HTTP and OAuth 2.1
- Familiarity with AI model integrations
- Access to development infrastructure
- Team buy-in for standardization

3. Step-by-Step Action Plan:

Step 1: Assessment Phase (2-3 weeks)
- Audit existing tool integrations and endpoints
- Document current authentication methods
- Map out service dependencies
- Tool needed: System architecture documentation software

Step 2: MCP Gateway Design (3-4 weeks)
- Design centralized MCP gateway architecture
- Define security requirements and protocols
- Plan authentication handling
- Tools needed: Architecture design software, security framework

Step 3: Infrastructure Setup (2-3 weeks)
- Set up development environment
- Implement base MCP gateway service
- Configure network connectivity
- Tools needed: Cloud infrastructure, development tools

Step 4: Integration Implementation (4-6 weeks)
- Develop standard MCP client libraries
- Create authentication handlers
- Implement logging and monitoring
- Tools needed: Development IDE, testing framework

Step 5: Security Implementation (2-3 weeks)
- Set up credential management
- Implement audit logging
- Configure access controls
- Tools needed: Security tools, audit framework

Step 6: Testing and Validation (3-4 weeks)
- Perform integration testing
- Conduct security testing
- Run performance benchmarks
- Tools needed: Testing tools, benchmarking software

4. Expected Outcomes:
- Centralized tool integration system
- Standardized authentication
- Reduced duplication of functionality
- Improved security control
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Better scalability

5. Common Pitfalls to Avoid:
- Over-customizing the implementation
- Neglecting security considerations
- Insufficient documentation
- Not planning for scale
- Ignoring existing use cases
- Lack of monitoring and observability
- Not providing adequate training for teams

Additional Recommendations:
- Start with a small pilot project
- Document everything thoroughly
- Create clear API documentation
- Establish monitoring from day one
- Regular security audits
- Maintain version compatibility
- Create user training materials

Total Estimated Timeline: 16-23 weeks depending on organization size and complexity

Remember to adjust the timeline and steps based on your organization's specific needs and resources.
