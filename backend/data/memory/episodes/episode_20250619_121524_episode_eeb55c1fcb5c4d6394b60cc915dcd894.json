Let's talk about it with Darkh Patel, one of the leading voices on AI, who's here with us in studio to cover it all. Duarkesh, great to see you. Welcome back to the show. Thanks for having me, man. Thanks for being here. I was listening to our last episode, which we recorded last year, and we were anticipating what was going to happen with GPT5. Still no GPT5. That's right. Oh, yeah. That would have surprised me a year ago. Definitely. And another thing that would have surprised me is we were saying that we were at a moment where we were going to figure out basically what's going to happen with AI progress, whether the traditional method of training LLMs was going to hit a wall or whether it wasn't. We were going to find out. We were basically months away from knowing the answer to that. Here we are a year later. We have everybody's looking at the same data. Like I mentioned in the intro, right? We have no idea. There are people who are saying AGI, artificial general intelligence or human level intelligence is imminent with the methods that are available today and there are others that are saying 20 30 maybe longer may maybe more than 30 years until we reach it. So let me ask start by asking you this. If we're all looking at the same data, why are there such vastly different perspectives on where this goes? I think people have...\n```\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Full transcript:** 74,150 characters \u2022 13,967 words\n\n\ud83d\udcbe **Click 'Save Transcript & Action Plan' below to download the complete transcript**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccb Action Plan\n\nBased on this transcript portion, I'll create an action plan focused on realistic AI implementation in business:\n\nSUMMARY:\nThe video discusses the challenges of implementing AI in business settings, particularly focusing on the limitations of current LLMs and why they haven't been widely adopted in Fortune 500 companies. It emphasizes the difference between human learning capabilities and AI's current limitations in continuous learning.\n\nPREREQUISITES:\n- Basic understanding of LLMs and AI capabilities\n- Business use case identification\n- Access to AI/LLM tools\n- Realistic expectations about AI limitations\n\nACTION PLAN:\n\n1. Assessment Phase (2-3 weeks)\n   - Audit current business processes\n   - Identify potential AI implementation areas\n   - Document specific task requirements\n   Tools needed: Process mapping software, documentation tools\n\n2. Task Classification (1 week)\n   - Separate tasks into:\n     a) Single-interaction tasks\n     b) Learning-dependent tasks\n     c) Context-heavy tasks\n   - Prioritize tasks that don't require continuous learning\n   Tools needed: Spreadsheet software, task analysis framework\n\n3. Pilot Program Design (2 weeks)\n   - Select 2-3 contained, low-risk processes\n   - Set up measurement metrics\n   - Create baseline performance data\n   Tools needed: Analytics tools, project management software\n\n4. Implementation Setup (3-4 weeks)\n   - Configure AI tools for selected tasks\n   - Develop clear prompting guidelines\n   - Create backup processes\n   Tools needed: Selected AI/LLM platforms, documentation tools\n\n5. Testing & Validation (4 weeks)\n   - Run parallel processes (AI vs. traditional)\n   - Document success rates\n   - Identify failure points\n   Tools needed: Testing framework, monitoring tools\n\nEXPECTED OUTCOMES:\n- Clear understanding of AI capabilities vs. limitations\n- Successful implementation of AI for appropriate tasks\n- Realistic ROI expectations\n- Documented process for future AI implementations\n\nPITFALLS TO AVOID:\n1. Over-relying on AI for learning-dependent tasks\n2. Expecting continuous improvement without human intervention\n3. Neglecting backup systems\n4. Assuming prompting alone can solve complexity issues\n5. Implementing AI in critical processes without proper testing\n\nMONITORING & ADJUSTMENT:\n- Regular performance reviews (bi-weekly)\n- Documentation of both successes and failures\n- Continuous refinement of implementation strategy\n- Regular stakeholder updates\n\nThis action plan focuses on practical implementation while acknowledging the current limitations of AI systems, particularly their inability to learn continuously like humans do.",
