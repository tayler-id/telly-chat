Then Deepseek pulled off 8bit training and now we are pushing the limits with only four bits. This sounds absurd because four-bit gradients are brutally coarse and in theory models shouldn't even converge. Yet, this very new paper claims that they trained an entire model in floating point 4 and matched the precision of a floatingoint 16 baseline. But of course, there's more to the story than the headline reveals. This video is part of a longer series on quantization, but is fully self-contained. We'll talk about how Nvidia's Tensor Core supports mixed precision training, the new floatingoint formats designed specifically for quantization values, and the modeling tricks that make 4-bit gradients work. As always, you'll find my reading list and the slide deck on Patreon for free. So, let's dive in. We're all very much aware that training LLM is really expensive. A Stamford report estimated that training Gemini Ultra must have cost a little under $200 million in compute and GBT4 about half of that. Though Sam Alman claims even that is an underestimation and more recently the anthropic CEO revealed that training claw 3.7 costs a few tens of millions of dollars. Research labs from China like Deepseek and Quen managed to reduce the cost of training LLMs by a factor of 10, though it's still in the millions. Much of Deepseek V3's cost efficiency comes from pushing all the heavy matrix multiplications down to floating...\n```\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Full transcript:** 20,397 characters \u2022 3,402 words\n\n\ud83d\udcbe **Click 'Save Transcript & Action Plan' below to download the complete transcript**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccb Action Plan\n\nBased on the video transcript, here's a comprehensive action plan for implementing mixed precision training:\n\nSUMMARY\nThe video discusses the evolution of model training precision from 16-bit to 4-bit, focusing on how modern systems achieve efficient training using mixed precision approaches. It explains the role of Nvidia's Tensor Cores and various technical innovations that make low-precision training possible.\n\nPREREQUISITES\n- Access to modern GPU hardware (preferably Nvidia H100 or newer)\n- Understanding of deep learning fundamentals\n- Programming knowledge in deep learning frameworks\n- Familiarity with matrix operations and floating-point formats\n\nSTEP-BY-STEP ACTION PLAN\n\n1. Hardware Setup (1-2 weeks)\n   - Acquire compatible GPU hardware with Tensor Core support\n   - Set up development environment\n   - Install necessary drivers and CUDA toolkit\n   Tools needed: Nvidia GPU, CUDA toolkit, appropriate cooling systems\n\n2. Framework Implementation (2-3 weeks)\n   - Set up mixed precision training framework\n   - Implement support for multiple precision formats (FP32, FP16, FP8, FP4)\n   - Configure tensor core operations\n   Tools needed: PyTorch/TensorFlow, CUDA programming tools\n\n3. Model Architecture Adaptation (2-3 weeks)\n   - Identify components requiring different precision levels\n   - Modify matrix multiplication operations for mixed precision\n   - Implement precision-specific layers\n   Tools needed: Deep learning framework, model architecture documentation\n\n4. Training Pipeline Setup (1-2 weeks)\n   - Configure gradient accumulation\n   - Implement precision switching mechanisms\n   - Set up monitoring systems for numerical stability\n   Tools needed: Training framework, monitoring tools\n\n5. Testing and Validation (2-3 weeks)\n   - Benchmark performance against baseline models\n   - Test numerical stability\n   - Validate model accuracy\n   Tools needed: Benchmarking suite, validation datasets\n\nEXPECTED OUTCOMES\n- Reduced memory usage (up to 40%)\n- Increased training speed (up to 1.8x)\n- Maintained model accuracy compared to higher precision training\n- Lower computational costs\n\nCOMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID\n1. Don't apply low precision universally - some operations require higher precision\n2. Watch for numerical instability in gradient calculations\n3. Avoid underestimating memory requirements for accumulation\n4. Don't skip validation against baseline models\n5. Be careful with hardware compatibility assumptions\n\nMONITORING METRICS\n- Training loss convergence\n- Memory usage\n- Training speed (steps/second)\n- Model accuracy compared to baseline\n- Numerical stability metrics\n\nNote: Timeframes are estimates and may vary based on team expertise and specific implementation requirements. Regular testing and validation throughout the process is crucial for success.",
