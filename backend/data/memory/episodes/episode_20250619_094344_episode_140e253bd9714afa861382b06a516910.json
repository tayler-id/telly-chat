Hello. Wow, a lot of people here. Hello. Um, okay. Yeah. So I'm excited to be here today to talk to you about software in the era of AI. And I'm told that many of you are students like bachelors, masters, PhD and so on. And you're about to enter the industry. And I think it's actually like an extremely unique and very interesting time to enter the industry right now. And I think fundamentally the reason for that is that um software is changing uh again. And I say again because I actually gave this talk already. Um but the problem is that software keeps changing. So I actually have a lot of material to create new talks and I think it's changing quite fundamentally. I think roughly speaking software has not changed much on such a fundamental level for 70 years. And then it's changed I think about twice quite rapidly in the last few years. And so there's just a huge amount of work to do a huge amount of software to write and rewrite. So let's take a look at maybe the realm of software. So if we kind of think of this as like the map of software this is a really cool tool called map of GitHub. Um this is kind of like all the software that's written. Uh these are instructions to the computer for carrying out tasks in the digital space. So if you zoom in here, these are all different kinds of repositories and this is all the code that has been written. And a few years ago I kind of observed that um software was kind of chang...\n```\n\n\ud83d\udcca **Full transcript:** 42,922 characters \u2022 8,251 words\n\n\ud83d\udcbe **Click 'Save Transcript & Action Plan' below to download the complete transcript**\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udccb Action Plan\n\nSoftware Evolution Action Plan\nBased on Andre Karpathy's presentation about the evolution of software in the AI era\n\nBrief Summary:\nThe video discusses the evolution of software through three paradigms: traditional programming (Software 1.0), neural networks (Software 2.0), and Large Language Models (Software 3.0). It emphasizes how developers need to adapt to this new landscape where programming can be done through multiple approaches, including natural language.\n\nPrerequisites:\n- Basic programming knowledge\n- Understanding of neural networks\n- Familiarity with LLMs and prompt engineering\n- Access to development tools and AI platforms\n\nStep-by-Step Action Plan:\n\n1. Master Software 1.0 Fundamentals (2-3 months)\n   - Learn a traditional programming language (Python/C++)\n   - Practice writing conventional code\n   - Tools needed: IDE, Git, GitHub\n   \n2. Develop Software 2.0 Skills (2-3 months)\n   - Study neural network architectures\n   - Learn frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow\n   - Practice training and deploying models\n   - Tools needed: ML frameworks, GPU access, Hugging Face account\n\n3. Embrace Software 3.0 Capabilities (1-2 months)\n   - Study prompt engineering\n   - Learn LLM interaction patterns\n   - Practice writing effective prompts\n   - Tools needed: Access to GPT-4, Claude, or similar LLMs\n\n4. Build Hybrid Applications (2-3 months)\n   - Create projects combining all three paradigms\n   - Practice switching between approaches\n   - Evaluate which paradigm fits different use cases\n   - Tools needed: Full development stack + AI tools\n\n5. Stay Current with AI Utilities (Ongoing)\n   - Set up accounts with major AI providers\n   - Learn to use tools like OpenRouter\n   - Monitor costs and performance metrics\n   - Tools needed: API access to various AI services\n\nExpected Outcomes:\n- Ability to work across all three software paradigms\n- Skill in choosing the right approach for each problem\n- Capability to build modern AI-powered applications\n- Understanding of AI utility ecosystem\n\nCommon Pitfalls to Avoid:\n1. Over-relying on any single paradigm\n2. Neglecting traditional programming fundamentals\n3. Ignoring cost considerations in AI solutions\n4. Not considering scalability and maintenance\n5. Failing to stay updated with rapid AI developments\n\nTotal Estimated Time: 7-11 months plus ongoing learning\n\nNote: This plan assumes dedicated part-time learning alongside other responsibilities. Timelines can be adjusted based on prior experience and available time commitment.",
