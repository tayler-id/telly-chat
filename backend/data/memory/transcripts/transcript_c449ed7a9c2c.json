Let's talk about it with Darkh Patel, one of the leading voices on AI, who's here with us in studio to cover it all. Duarkesh, great to see you. Welcome back to the show. Thanks for having me, man. Thanks for being here. I was listening to our last episode, which we recorded last year, and we were anticipating what was going to happen with GPT5. Still no GPT5. That's right. Oh, yeah. That would have surprised me a year ago. Definitely. And another thing that would have surprised me is we were saying that we were at a moment where we were going to figure out basically what's going to happen with AI progress, whether the traditional method of...\n```\n\ud83d\udcca **Full transcript:** 74,150 characters \u2022 13,967 words\n---",
  "action_plan": "SUMMARY\nA discussion between the host and Darkh Patel about the varying perspectives on AI progress and the timeline to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The conversation focuses on why experts have such different views despite looking at the same data.\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\u2022 There are vastly different expert opinions on AGI timeline (from imminent to 30+ years away)\n\u2022 Different philosophies about what constitutes intelligence lead to different predictions\n\u2022 Some experts believe current models are \"baby AGIs\" needing minor improvements\n\u2022 Others believe fundamental algorithmic progress is still needed\n\u2022 Continuous learning and memory retention are current major limitations\nACTION ITEMS\n1. Evaluate your own perspective on AI intelligence and what constitutes AGI\n2. Research different viewpoints on AI progress timelines\n3. Stay informed about developments in continuous learning AI capabilities\n4. Monitor progress of GPT-5 and other major AI model releases\n5. Consider how current AI limitations (like session memory) affect practical applications\nRESOURCES MENTIONED\n- GPT-5 (referenced but not yet released)\n- Test time thinking (mentioned as feature in versions 01 and 03)\n- Slack (mentioned in context of AI tools integration)\nNEXT STEPS\n1. Follow AI experts with different perspectives to understand various viewpoints\n2. Stay updated on developments in continuous learning AI systems\n3. Consider how current AI limitations might affect your own AI implementation plans\n4. Monitor news about major AI model releases and breakthroughs",
